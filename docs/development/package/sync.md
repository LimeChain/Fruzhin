## FullSync

### Overview
The `fullsync` subpackage is responsible for managing the full synchronization process, ensuring that nodes can download and verify the entire blockchain from the genesis block to the latest block.

### Components

#### FullSyncMachine
- **Purpose**: Coordinates the steps involved in a full blockchain synchronization.
- **Functionality**: Initiates block requests, processes received blocks, and handles the transition between different synchronization states.

### Usage
The `fullsync` subpackage is used when nodes perform an initial sync.

## WarpSync

### Overview
`warpsync` focuses on speeding up the synchronization process through a mechanism known as Warp Sync, which involves downloading compressed snapshots of the blockchain state.

### Components

#### WarpSyncMachine
- **Purpose**: Manages the warp sync process, which allows nodes to quickly catch up to the current blockchain state without downloading all individual blocks.
- **Functionality**: Orchestrates the downloading of state fragments, verification of data integrity, and integration of the state into the nodeâ€™s local blockchain.

#### SyncedState
- **Purpose**: Maintains a shared state across the warp sync process, storing critical information such as the current sync status and received data fragments.
- **Functionality**: Ensures that all components involved in the warp sync process can access and modify the sync state coherently.

### Usage
`warpsync` is particularly useful in environments where bandwidth or storage is limited, or when nodes need to rapidly update their state to the latest consensus without the overhead of processing all historical blocks.
