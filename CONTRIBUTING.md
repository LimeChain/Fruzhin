# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Fruzhin! We welcome contributions from everyone. To maintain a high standard of quality, please follow these guidelines when contributing to the project.

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for our commit messages. Each commit message should have a clear and structured format that conveys the type, scope, and description of the changes made. This helps in understanding the purpose of each commit and automating tasks like versioning and changelog generation.

## Merge Process

When submitting a new pull request (PR), please ensure the following:

- **Target the `dev` branch**: All new PRs must target the `dev` branch.
- **Use our PR template**: Utilize our [PR template](https://github.com/limechain/Fruzhin/tree/dev/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) to ensure all necessary information is included.
- **Pass the tests**: Ensure that all tests are passing.
- **Update the docs**: Ensure that all relevant changes are reflected in the docs.
- **Have 2 approvals from the core dev team**: PRs should have approvals from at least two members of the core development team before merging.

Additional recommendations:
- Write tests for logic related to modules.

## Release Process

We use the `dev` branch for ongoing development. Once the development is complete and ready for release, changes are merged into the `master` branch.
